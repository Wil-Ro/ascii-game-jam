- Names with leading and trailing underscores are reserved for system purposes and should not be used for any user-created names. Most systems use them for names that the user should not have to know. If you must have your own private identifiers, begin them with a letter or two identifying the package to which they belong.

- #define constants should be in all CAPS.

- Enum constants are Capitalized or in all CAPS

- Function, typedef, and variable names, as well as struct, union, and enum tag names should be in lower case.

- Many macro "functions" are in all CAPS. Some macros (such as getchar and putchar) are in lower case since they may also exist as functions. Lower-case macro names are only acceptable if the macros behave like a function call, that is, they evaluate their parameters exactly once and do not assign values to named parameters. Sometimes it is impossible to write a macro that behaves like a function even though the arguments are evaluated exactly once.
